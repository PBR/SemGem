Semantic genebank integration

Prototype application to show the potential of integration of information from
a Breeding database with records from genebanks. This integration relies on
Semantic web technology (RDFa annotations) in the pages of both databases

This prototype is described in the manuscript: Genebanks and genomics: how to interconnect data from both communities?, which is published in Plant Genetic Resources (http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1479262114000689).
